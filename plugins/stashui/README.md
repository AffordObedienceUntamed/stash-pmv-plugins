# Stash UI

A complete new interface for [Stash](https://github.com/stashapp/stash), built from scratch in the look of **Media Storm**:

- **Colors**: ink (plum) as the background, paper (blush white) for text, blush pink for actions and favorites, a cool sheen for keyboard focus.
- **Motifs**: blush hatching (////) marks active sections, a halftone screen in the background, messages as speech bubbles, the “STASH” lettering slanted like a sound effect.
- Thumbnails in justified rows (adjustable size); titles and details appear on hover.
- **Heart** = favorite.
- Font: Bahnschrift (included with Windows; other systems fall back to a similar sans-serif).

Open it: just open Stash (e.g. `http://localhost:9999`) – the home page redirects to Stash UI. Directly: `/plugin/stashui/assets/index.html`.

## Sections

| Section | What it does |
|---|---|
| Start | Greeting, figures, continue watching, **for you** (unwatched scenes with the tags you watched most this week – it says which), **long time no see** (favorites and 4-star scenes not watched for a month), favorites, recently added, folders, random (“Shuffle”). **Customize**: show/hide sections, drag them into your order, and add your own – scenes, images or both, sorted as you like, filtered by tags, performers or favorites, 8–40 items (kept in this browser) |
| Search | Across everything: tags, folders, scenes, images, galleries |
| Scenes / Images / Galleries | Justified rows with search, sorting, filters (include/exclude tags, performers, rating, favorites, watched, resolution, duration, format), infinite scrolling, preview video on hover |
| Folders | Every folder with cover images, subfolders and its items; “Include subfolders” shows everything below. The folder tree sits in the navigation on the left. Folders without scenes and images are hidden |
| Performers | Photo cards with search, sorting (name, scenes, O counter, rating, most watched, newest, random), gender and favorites filter; the heart on a card marks a favorite right away. The performer page shows photo, facts (age, country, height, measurements …), rating, heart, tags and links, then all their scenes, images and galleries with the usual filters. **Edit** covers everything: photo (upload, link, drop or paste), all fields (the ones your Stash version has), tags – and **Fill in from the internet**: search StashDB-style boxes or your performer scrapers (e.g. FreeOnes) by name, or paste a profile link; found values go into empty fields (or replace all, if you tick it), found pictures can be picked, StashDB links are kept. A new performer opens straight in the editor, already searching by the name. A tag on a performer doesn't link anything in Stash – if items carry one of the performer's tags (e.g. a creator tag from a downloader), or lie in a folder named like the performer (name, alias or tag), but aren't linked, the performer page says so and **Link them** adds the performer to all of them in one go (“Not this tag / folder” hides the hint). Scenes, images and galleries always have their own tab, even while one of them is still empty. Performers also show in the player's info bar and in search |
| Tags | List of all tags, tag page with all items and its performers (those with the tag, and those in scenes with it), edit/delete tags, create new tags |
| Gallery | All images, slideshow, rating, heart, edit |
| Queue | Play items one after another, reorder by dragging, shuffle |
| What's new | The patch notes of Stash UI, the PMV Generator and Media Storm, newest first (English and Chinese); a dot in the menu while there's something you haven't opened yet |
| Interactive | Scenes with a funscript play on **The Handy**: it follows play, pause, jumps and repeat (status in the player bar – click to connect again), the funscript's intensity shows under the timeline. Settings → Player and previews: connection key, script offset, “The Handy fetches the script from Stash”, and a connection test – the same settings as classic Stash. Lists can filter by funscript; such scenes get a small mark. **The Handy menu** (click the Handy button in the player): sync offset (−250 … +250 ms), stroke range, invert, the device with model and firmware, the connection key, connect again / disconnect. **Funscript** in the info bar lists every .funscript in your Stash library folders (the ones matching the video first, with search; “From this computer …” too). Stash finds funscripts by name (video.mp4 → video.funscript next to it), so Stash UI's small backend (Python, like the PMV Generator's) puts the chosen one there – an existing one is kept as .funscript.bak – and has Stash scan that video; the choice stays with the scene (after restarts, in classic Stash too) until you switch or remove it. The scene then opens again, ready for the Handy |
| Interactive | All scenes with a funscript (a normal list – search, sort, filter, play), and the .funscript files in the library that don't belong to a video yet: **Choose video …** suggests scenes with a similar name (or search) and assigns it like the player does |
| Playlists | Smart playlists: set filters in Scenes or Images (tags, performers, rating, never watched, resolution, length, format, favorites, sort) and press **Save as playlist** – it always holds what matches now. Play, shuffle or add to the queue with one click; open one to change its filters and save again. Kept in Stash, so they're the same in every browser – and the PMV Generator can take its clips from one |
| History | Everything you've watched, most recent first |
| Versus | Two scenes, images, performers or **moments** (markers – each plays its stretch in a loop) side by side – click (or ←/→) the better one. Every pick moves an Elo standing: beating a stronger one counts more. Three ways to play: **fair matches** (similar strength, least played first), **winner stays** (how long a streak?) and **climb** (a newcomer climbs until it loses – that's its place); optional tag filter, **U** undoes, **F** plays it fullscreen, the card under the mouse is heard, a level every 25 picks. **Ranking** shows the top 100 with points and wins–losses. The standings are kept in Stash, so they're the same in every browser and on every device (merged if you play on two); only **Turn into star ratings** changes ratings (top 10 % five stars … bottom 10 % one star, only those with 3+ matches – it asks first). The upper quarter of the moments (3+ matches) are your **best moments**: the player marks them gold, J jumps there first, a random start lands on one, and the PMV Generator prefers them. |
| Media Storm | Opens the Media Storm panel – shown when the Media Storm plugin is installed |
| PMV Generator | Opens the PMV Generator – shown when the PMV Generator plugin is installed |
| Tasks | Scan for new files, generate previews, auto tag, clean – with live progress and stop |
| Statistics | **Achievements**: a streak of days in a row (and your best), and medals in steps – plays, hours watched, how much of the library you've seen, night owl, Versus picks, O – with the way to the next step; new ones are announced. **Your week** (watch time, plays, most watched scene, top performer and tag, busiest day – against the week before), then everything for a chosen period (7 / 30 / 90 days, a year, all time) compared with the period before: watch time, plays, different scenes (and how many for the first time), O; activity by day, week or month with quick looks shown apart; top scenes, performers, tags and studios with trend and a small curve over the period; weekday and time of day; how much of the library you've seen and what you never watched. Count by watch time or by plays. Comes from the play and O history Stash keeps for every scene |
| Duplicates | Scenes that look the same (Stash's perceptual hashes), side by side with resolution, codec, bitrate and size – the best copy is marked. Delete single copies or “keep the best” in one click; deleting the files from disk is an extra checkbox. “Not duplicates” hides a group. Needs phashes (Tasks → Generate) |
| Settings | All Stash settings in sections: library, previews, playback, paths, login, log (with viewer), classic interface, DLNA, scrapers, more options, database (back up, optimize, clean up), this interface |
| Plugins | Installed: on/off, settings, run tasks, check for updates, update (one or all), uninstall. Browse: install plugins from your sources, with search. Sources: add, edit, remove plugin sources – no need to go to classic Stash |
| Classic Stash | The original Stash in the same look, embedded with quick picks: performers, studios, groups, markers, scene tagger, scrapers, tools, settings |

## Languages

Stash UI is available in **English** and **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**. By default it follows the interface language set in Stash (classic Stash → Settings → Interface → Language); you can also pick one under **Settings → This interface → Language**.

### Help translate

Translations live in `app/js/locales/` – one file per language, English text → translation:

```js
export default {
  "Scenes": "场景",
  "{n} days ago": "{n} 天前",
};
```

- Anything missing simply shows in English, so partial translations work.
- `python tools/i18n_keys.py zh-CN` lists the texts a language file is still missing.
- A new language: copy `zh-CN.js`, translate the values, and add it to `LANGS` and `FILES` in `app/js/i18n.js`.
- Found an odd or too long wording? Open an issue or a pull request.

## Works with the other plugins

Other people's plugins show up in the menu under **Extensions**, each pointing to the best place it has: its own web page (e.g. Stash TV), a page it adds to classic Stash (e.g. Stash Downloader – opened embedded), its card on the Plugins page with tasks and settings (plugins that only have those), or classic Stash for plugins that only add a button there. Libraries, font loaders and themes get no entry.


Stash UI works on its own. If you also install **Media Storm** or the **PMV Generator** (same plugin source), they show up in the menu under **Watch** – entries of plugins that aren't installed or are turned off are hidden. The PMV Generator opens as its own page; its back link and saved scenes lead back into Stash UI.

## Player

- Custom controls, timeline with thumbnails on hover, speed, volume, fullscreen.
- Portrait videos (9:16) are fitted completely, nothing is cropped.
- **Resume**: starts where you left off (button “From the start”), saves progress and counts plays like Stash.
- **Start at a random spot** (sliders menu or Settings → Player and previews): every scene starts somewhere between 5 % and 85 % – for just looking around. Your resume points in Stash aren't touched (the play still counts); “From the start” in the hint switches back to normal for that scene.
- One button for how it goes on at the end – a click cycles through **In order**, **Random order**, **Repeat this video**, **Repeat all** and **Stop at the end** (also under Settings → Player and previews); “Up next” in the info bar.
- The info bar on the right (key **I**): rating (in the rating system set under Settings → This interface → Rating system – the same setting classic Stash uses: whole, half, quarter or tenth stars – click where on the star, hovering shows the value – or 0.0–10.0), heart, O counter (right-click subtracts one), performers (× removes one, **+** adds one or creates a new performer), tags, edit, queue, folder.
- **Own markers**: **B** (or the sliders menu) sets a marker at the current spot – a yellow pin on the timeline, **J** jumps to it like to the highlights. The info bar lists them: jump, rename, delete. They're Stash's scene markers (tag “Highlight”), so classic Stash shows them too.
- **Cover** in the info bar: pause where you like and the picture becomes the scene's cover. Try as many frames as you like: **Undo** in the message or **Old cover** next to it steps back, instantly. Stash only gets the final cover – a few seconds after the last change, or when you leave the scene (on Windows, Stash can't replace a cover file it has just written for up to 2 minutes; this way that doesn't get in the way).
- **Highlights** (switch in the bar): a heat curve sits above the timeline, diamonds mark the best spots – click or press **J** to jump to the next one. The curve combines two things:
  - **Motion**: from Stash's preview sprites (timeline thumbnails) – how much the picture changes, plus the share of skin. Needs generated sprites (Tasks → Generate previews).
  - **Your watching**: which parts you actually watch and where you seek to. Stored only in this browser (the last 400 scenes).
- **Mini player** (button next to fullscreen, key **X**): the player closes, the video keeps playing small in a corner while you browse – history and progress keep counting. Drag it anywhere; resize it by pulling any edge or corner, or with the mouse wheel over it (it keeps the video's shape and remembers where it was); the title or ⤢ goes back to the player at the same spot, ▣ floats it above other windows (picture in picture).
- **Music** in the info bar (with the PMV Generator installed): the sound of this video from/to any point (“Here” takes the current position) – **Open in PMV Generator** (it opens with the video and the part already picked), **Download** as .m4a, or **Save to library** (folder “PMV Generator/Songs”). ffmpeg (the one Stash brings) does the cutting.
- **Cast to TV** in the gear menu: sends the video to a Chromecast / Google TV (Chrome, Edge) or AirPlay (Safari) – the browser's own device picker.
- **Similar** in the info bar: up to 8 matching scenes – shared performers count most, then studio, share of common tags and the same folder; the best ones are also sorted by the look of the thumbnail (color, brightness, composition). Every suggestion shows the reason (e.g. “3 shared tags”, “similar look”). If a scene has no metadata, only the look decides.

## Install as an app

Settings → General → **Install as app**: Stash UI gets its own window and a home screen / start menu icon, without the browser bar (Chrome, Edge, Safari on iPhone via Share → Add to Home Screen). Browsers only install apps from https or on the computer Stash runs on (localhost) – on a phone that opens Stash by its network address, “Add to Home screen” adds a normal shortcut instead.

## Selecting and editing

- The box in the top left of an item, Ctrl+click or Shift+click (range) selects. A bar appears at the bottom: select all, set/remove favorite, edit together (add/remove tags, rating, organized), add to queue, delete (optionally with files).
- Edit a single item: title, rating, heart, tags (including creating new ones), performers (including creating new ones), date, description, links, organized, delete. Editing several together can also add or remove performers.
- **Studio on scenes** (Settings → General): the studio's logo – or its name – in the corner of scene thumbnails.
- The menu on the left: a click on a group heading folds the group away. Settings → General → **Other plugins in the menu** hides the Extensions group or single plugins in it.

## Technical notes

- `app/` is the interface (plain JavaScript ES modules, no build step), `classic/` styles classic Stash and redirects the home page.
- **Favorites** = the Stash tag “Favorite” (created with the first heart).
- **Settings**: grouped into This interface (Appearance, Player and previews, General), Stash and More, with a search box that finds any setting across all sections and jumps to it.
- **Sound in previews**: hover previews play with sound (Settings → Player and previews). Stash only puts sound into previews when “Preview audio” is on under Previews.
- **Player menu** (gear next to fullscreen): quality (original or Stash's transcodes), subtitles (Stash's captions – the section appears when a scene has some), VR and speed.
- **VR**: 180°/360° videos, mono, side by side or top/bottom – drag to look around, wheel or two fingers to zoom. Guessed from the file name (e.g. `_180_LR`) or a "VR" tag, and remembered per scene. Shows one eye on a normal screen; headsets aren't supported yet.
- **Fullscreen**: move the mouse near the right edge to slide in the info panel (Settings → This interface → “Info panel in fullscreen”).
- **Colors**: Settings → This interface → Colors. Pick a preset (Plum, Midnight, OLED black, Forest, Ember, Ocean, Violet, Classic Stash) or set each color – accent, backgrounds, text, success/error – with the color wheel. Save your own colors as presets. Optional **background image**: a random image with the tag “background” (the same images the Random Backgrounds plugin uses in classic Stash) – on every start or, if switched on, on every page – or one image you choose (from those images or any URL), with a darken slider. Optional **Liquid glass** (transparency slider, blur can be switched off): see-through, blurred panels with a light edge over a soft glow in the theme colors – the photo or video under the mouse tints the background, and in the player the running video glows behind the info panel and into the black bars. Saved in the browser; the PMV Generator uses the same look.
- **Keep the classic home page**: Settings → This interface → “This interface as home page” off (or the plugin setting “Keep classic home page”). For a single tab: `http://localhost:9999/?classic=1`.
- Pages that only exist in classic Stash (registered by other plugins) are embedded through classic Stash; its navigation is hidden there.
- After changing files in `app/`: run `python tools/build.py --sync-only` from the repository root – it copies the shared files to the PMV Generator plugin and sets version stamps so browsers don't load stale files from their cache.
- **Folders** in the navigation and on the home page need one count of the whole library. The result is remembered in the browser and only counted again when the number of scenes/images changes or after a scan, clean or deletion. On very large libraries set Settings → General → “Folder loading” to “Only on the Folders page” or “Off” (no folders are loaded at all; the Folders page offers “Load anyway”).
- Classic Stash gets its look directly from this plugin. Other themes that restyle classic Stash may clash with it – turn them off if things look odd.
